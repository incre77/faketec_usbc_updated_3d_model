# faketec_usbc_updated
A 3d model for faketec with usbc updated to 2026
I found this model from:https://www.printables.com/model/1102989-faketec-nrf52-meshtastic-case-with-encoderbuzzergp

And i aplied this scad script i saw in this comment:

Heads up that fakeTec v5 doesn't work with this design as the type-c port is closer to the PCB because of the removal of the header pins.

Also do note there is this faketec v5 custom fork https://github.com/jtljac/fakeTec_pcb which exposes extra pads for attaching an encoder if anyone is interested. Just need the case modified here and it be all good!

(edit: Created this openscad script which will modify the front case to shift the type-c port by 2.50mm to allow fakeTec v5 to fit. https://gist.github.com/mofosyne/48c85aaf8f9d6235b8dff4756ea68b25) (edited)"
